            </h3> 
            <p>In Android, Design Architecture refers to structuring the code in a way that increases its readability, maintainability, and testability. There are several ways to design architecture like Model-View-Controller (MVC), Model-View-Presenter (MVP), Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), and Model-View-Intent (MVI). Each of these define the interaction between the data, the logic, and the UI layers. Googleâ€™s recommended architectural pattern is Android Architecture Components which follow the principles of the MVVM pattern. Bear in mind that an architecture is not a rigid structure that fits all solutions. Rather, it serves as a guideline and can be tweaked as necessary.
