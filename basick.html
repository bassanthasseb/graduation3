            <h3>Basics of Kotlin 
 
            </h3> 
            <p>Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be used to develop all types of Android apps. It is Google’s preferred language for Android app development. Kotlin’s syntax is more concise than Java, which means less code to write and read, and fewer opportunities for errors. It provides several high-level features like lambdas, coroutines and higher order functions that help making the code more clean and understandable. Key basics of Kotlin include control flow statements (if, when, for, while), variables (mutable and non-mutable), null safety, classes and objects, inheritance, interfaces, and exception handling. While learning Kotlin, experience with Java will certainly be helpful, but it’s not a prerequisite.<br>
