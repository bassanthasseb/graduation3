            <h3>Animations 
            </h3> 
            <p>In Android, animations are used to give a more visual, dynamic, and interactive aspect to a static user interface. Android offers four categories of animation APIs in order to create and manage the animations. These are: Property Animation: This allows modification of properties of an object over a given time period. View Animation: Consists of two subcategories i.e. Tween Animation (transition of a view from one state to another) and Frame Animation (displaying frames one after another). Drawable Animation: This is similar to a slideshow, showing one image after another. Lastly, Layout Animation: This is used to animate the layout itself when views are added or removed. 
 
              You can utilize Androidâ€™s built-in animations or fully customize your own to add unique transitions and movements in your applications. Every app can benefit from a touch of animation to create a more immersive and pleasant user experience.
