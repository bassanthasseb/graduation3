            <h3>Activity Lifecycle 
            </h3> 
            <p>The Activity Lifecycle in Android represents a series of states or events that an activity can go through from its creation to its destruction. The primary states or events are onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onDestroy(), and onRestart(). The method onCreate() is called when the activity is first created, followed by onStart() when the activity becomes visible to the user. The onResume() method executes when the user starts interacting with the application. onPause() and onStop() methods are invoked when the application is no longer in the foreground or visible to the user. The onDestroy() method is used when the activity is being completely removed from the memory. The onRestart() method is called after the system stops the activity and is about to start it again. The proper handling of these states ensures the efficient use of resources and a smooth user experience.<br>
