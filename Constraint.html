            </h3> 
            <p>ConstraintLayout is a ViewGroup that allows you to position and size widgets in a flexible way. It was added to Android Studio 2.2 in 2016. It’s similar to RelativeLayout in that all views are laid out according to relationships between sibling views and the parent layout, but it’s more flexible than RelativeLayout and easier to use with Android Studio’s Layout Editor. All direct children of a ConstraintLayout have a set of constraints that define their position. These constraints are used to position the child’s left or top edge relative to other views or the parent layout. The position and size for each view can be specified using a number of methods including baseline alignment, margins, and bias. ConstraintLayout works best with Android Studio’s Layout Editor where you can drag-and-drop views and then add constraints to fine-tune view positions.
