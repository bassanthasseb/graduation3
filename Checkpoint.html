            <p>At this point you should be able to build CLI applications using Node.js or whatever backend programming language you picked. 
 
              You should be able to build a CLI application that can: 
               
              Read and write files 
              Parse command line arguments 
              Make HTTP requests 
              Parse JSON 
              Use a third-party library (e.g. a library for parsing CSV files) 
              Use a third-party API 
              Here are some ideas for CLI applications you can build: 
               
              Create a CLI application that takes a URL and a CSS selector arguments and prints the text content of the element that matches the selector. Hint you can use cheerio 
              An application that takes optionally takes two dates and prints the most starred GitHub projects in that date range. Hint you can use GitHubâ€™s search API 
              Bulk rename files in a directory. Hint you can use fs and path 
              Write a CLI application that takes a path as input and compresses all the images in that directory. It should accept an option for output path; if the output path is not given it should compress images in place otherwise write the compressed images to the output path. Hint you can use sharp.
