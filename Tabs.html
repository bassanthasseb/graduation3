            <p>Tabs are commonly used in Android for switching between different views within the same activity. Some instances may make use of a TabLayout located within a ViewPager to create swipeable tabs. Each tab is usually associated with a fragment. To create tabs in Android, you need to use the TabLayout component that is available in the Material Design library. A typical TabLayout contains multiple TabItem, each representing a tab in the interface. The TabLayout works with a ViewPager to provide a consistent swipeable interface. Users can approach tabs differently depending on whether they are coded for manual or automatic filling. Manual tab creation and addition require explicit defining of each tab and adding them to the TabLayout, while in automatic filling tabs are generated from the PagerAdaptorâ€™s page title.
