            <p>At this point you should be able to build a complete frontend application including: 
 
              Structuring your webpages with HTML 
              Styling your webpages with CSS 
              Adding interactivity to your webpages with JavaScript 
              Using the DOM API to manipulate your webpages 
              Using the Fetch API to make HTTP requests 
              Understand promises and use async/await syntax to write asynchronous code 
              Installing and using external libraries with npm 
              Version controlling your code with Git 
              Pushing your code to GitHub 
              If you decided to skip React and Tailwind for now, that is fine also but you should be able to build a complete frontend application using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, keep in mind that the modern frontend applications are mostly built with frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular. So, you should learn at least one of them at any point of time. 
               
              This marks the end of frontend basics that you needed, we will now be moving to the backend development. While you continue with the backend development, know that there is more to frontend development and remember to checkout the frontend roadmap later in your journey.
