            <p>In Android, “Common Services” are functional units or components provided by the Android system for use by developers. These services include things such as Location Services (used to determine the device’s geographical location), Notification Services (handles the display and management of user notifications), and Sensor Services (interacts with hardware sensors). Other common services are Network and Connectivity Services, Account Manager, and Data Storage Services among others. They simplify the development process by handling complex functionalities behind the scenes, allowing developers to focus on the application’s specific needs.
