            <h3>The Fundamentals 
            </h3> 
            <p>”The Fundamentals” of Android primarily concentrate on 5 components; Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers, Content Providers, and Intents. Activities are essentially what you see on your screen; each screen in an app is a separate activity. Services run in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes. 
               They do not provide a user interface. Broadcast Receivers respond to broadcast messages from other applications or from the system itself. These messages are often in the form of Intents. Content Providers manage a shared set of app data that other apps can query or modify, through a structured interface. Finally, Intents are messaging objects which facilitate the communication between the aforementioned components. 
                Understanding these five core concepts is key to mastering Android fundamentals.<br>
