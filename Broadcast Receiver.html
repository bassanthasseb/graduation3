            <h3>Broadcast Receiver 
            </h3> 
            <p>Broadcast Receivers in Android are components that respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. They can be registered to respond to a specific type of broadcasts or implement a user-defined broadcast. While you can initiate a broadcast from your app, they are generally used for receiving system notifications or communicating with other applications. However, keep in mind that they cannot display a user interface, but they can start activities if necessary, which do have a user interface. A BroadcastReceiver class must override the onReceive() method where each message is received as an Intent object parameter.
