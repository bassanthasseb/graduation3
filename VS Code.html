            <p>To use VS Code for Flutter development, you must install the Flutter and Dart plugins for VS Code. These plugins support Flutter-specific features such as syntax highlighting, debugging, and hot reloading. 
 
              Here are the steps to set up VS Code for Flutter development: 
              Open VS Code and click the Extensions icon on the left-hand side of the window. 
              In the search box, type “Flutter” and press Enter. This will display a list of Flutter-related plugins. 
              Install the “Flutter” and “Dart” plugins by clicking the Install button next to each one. 
              Once the plugins are installed, you will need to restart VS Code for the changes to take effect. 
              To create a new Flutter project, click the File menu, then select New > New Project. This will open the New Project dialog box. 
              Select the Flutter application template, enter the project’s name and location and click Create. This will create a new Flutter project in the specified location. 
              To run the project, open the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac) and type “flutter run”. This will run the project on the default emulator or device. 
              That’s it! You should now be able to use VS Code for Flutter development.
