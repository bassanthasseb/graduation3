            <p>Activity in Android is a crucial component that represents a single screen with a user interface. It is just like a window in a desktop application. Android apps are typically made up of one or more activities, each having its interface which allows user interaction. When an app is launched, an instance of Activity is created, starting the lifecycle of that app. Every activity has its own lifecycle (create, start, resume, pause, stop, destroy) that keeps the state of a userâ€™s progress, and Android manages these states automatically. Activities can also have Intent, which allows them to interact with other components, such as starting another activity or getting a result from that activity.<br>
