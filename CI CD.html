            <p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that helps to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying mobile apps, including Flutter apps. 
 
              With CI/CD, developers can automate the build, test, and deployment process for their Flutter apps, making it easier to catch bugs and deploy new features quickly and efficiently. 
               
              The key components of a CI/CD pipeline for a Flutter app are: 
               
              Version control 
              Automated builds 
              Automated testing 
              Deployment
